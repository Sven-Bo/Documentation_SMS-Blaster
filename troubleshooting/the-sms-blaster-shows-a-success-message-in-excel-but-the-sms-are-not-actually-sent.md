# The SMS Blaster shows a success message in Excel, but the SMS are not actually sent

### Solution:

1. **Keep Pushbullet Open:**
   * In most cases, this can be resolved by opening the Pushbullet app on your smartphone and keeping it open while you send SMS from the Blaster.
2. **Verify Device ID:**
   * Ensure the correct device ID is entered in the SMS Blaster Settings tab. If you’ve recently changed phones, the old device ID may still be in use. Update it with your new device’s ID.
3. **Adjust Pushbullet Settings:**
   * Open the Pushbullet app on your Android device, go to the SMS tab, and tap _Allow SMS sync in the background_. Also, set Pushbullet to _Not be battery optimized_ by Android to ensure it runs properly in the background.
4. **If the above solutions don't work, try the following:**
   * Visit [Don't Kill My App](https://dontkillmyapp.com/), select your phone manufacturer, and follow the steps in the "Solutions for users" section.
   * Reinstall the Pushbullet Android app. This often resolves the issue for many users.

#### **Other Things to Check:**

* **Phone Turned Off:**
  * Pushbullet sends SMS through your phone, so messages cannot be sent if it’s turned off.
* **No Internet Connection:**
  * Ensure your phone is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi or mobile data to receive messages from Pushbullet.
* **Wi-Fi Blocking Messages:**
  * If you’re on a Wi-Fi network that blocks messages, try switching to mobile data to see if Pushbullet works correctly.
