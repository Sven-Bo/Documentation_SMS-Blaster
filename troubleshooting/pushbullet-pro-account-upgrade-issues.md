# Pushbullet PRO Account Upgrade Issues

**Problem:**

If you're encountering issues when trying to upgrade to a Pushbullet PRO account—such as payment being refunded or the upgrade process getting stuck—this could be due to automated fraud prevention measures recently implemented by Pushbullet.

**Why This Happens:**

Pushbullet has added automated checks to block fraudulent transactions. Unfortunately, some legitimate users may get caught in these filters, leading to automatic refunds or blocked upgrade attempts. This happens when certain account activities trigger their fraud prevention system, even if no suspicious behavior is intended.

**Solution:**

Please note that I am not affiliated with Pushbullet, nor am I an employee, so I cannot assist with Pushbullet account issues. However, I came across a similar issue on Reddit ([Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PushBullet/comments/1eboq1c/upgraded_to_pro_but_got_refunded/)), where users experienced the same problem, and a Pushbullet developer explained the situation.

Here’s what I suggest you do:

1. **Post on Reddit:**
   * Pushbullet developers seem to be responsive on Reddit. You can visit their subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PushBullet/) and explain the problem in a post. This has helped other users get their issues resolved.
2. **Contact Pushbullet Support:**
   * Pushbullet doesn’t have an official contact form, but you can email their support team directly at pro@pushbullet.com. Provide details about your account and the issue you’re facing. They may be able to adjust your account to bypass the automated checks.

While I cannot resolve this issue myself, I hope these steps help you get your PRO upgrade sorted with Pushbullet!
