# Can I use an eSIM?

Yes — **eSIM works just like a regular SIM card** with SMS Blaster.

The only thing you need to do is make sure it’s set as your **default SIM for sending SMS** in your Android settings. That tells your phone which number to use when sending out messages.

Once that’s set, SMS Blaster will handle everything else like normal.
