# Tips for writing effective SMS with SMS Blaster

Writing a good SMS isn’t rocket science, but getting it just right can make a big difference. With SMS Blaster, you’ve got the tools to send messages that feel personal, clear, and professional. Whether it’s a quick reminder or an important update, these tips will help you hit the mark every time.

✅ **Keep it personal**\
Use placeholders like `{{name}}` to address recipients directly. It makes the message feel personal and engaging.\
Example: <mark style="color:blue;">Hi \{{name\}}, our yoga class is at 6 PM today. Don’t forget your mat!</mark>

✅ **Be clear and concise**\
Stick to one main idea. SMS Blaster supports sending messages longer than 160 characters (which will be split into multiple SMS). However, keeping your message short and within 160 characters is ideal when possible.

✅ **Make it easy to read**\
For slightly longer messages, use line breaks to format your SMS neatly. In Excel, press **Alt + Enter** to add paragraphs.\
Example:\
<mark style="color:blue;">Hi \{{name\}},</mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;">We’re excited to see you!</mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;">Your yoga class is confirmed for \{{date\}} at 6 PM.</mark> \ <mark style="color:blue;">Please arrive 10 minutes early to settle in.</mark>

✅ **Use fallback solutions for placeholders**\
If some recipients don’t have data for specific placeholders, global placeholders can act as a fallback.\
Example: For missing names, `Hi {{name}}` can default to `Hi there`.

❌ **Using unprofessional formatting**\
Avoid all caps, excessive punctuation, or too many emojis. These can make your messages look spammy or unprofessional.\
&#xNAN;**⛔ Avoid:** <mark style="color:blue;">DON’T MISS THIS!!!!!</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**🎉🎉🎉**</mark>\
&#xNAN;**✅ Better**_**:**_ <mark style="color:blue;">Reminder: Don’t miss today’s special event at our studio at 6 PM!</mark>

❌ **Not testing placeholders**\
Forgetting to test placeholders can lead to awkward or unprofessional messages. Use SMS Blaster’s **Test Mode** to preview your messages and confirm placeholders like `{{name}}` are replaced correctly.
