# How do I warm up my SIM card

Before you start sending hundreds of texts a day, there’s one important step you don’t want to skip — warming up your SIM card.

It’s a bit like stretching before a workout. You might feel ready to go full speed, but if your SIM jumps into high-volume messaging too soon, your carrier might slam the brakes. Not fun.

#### Why Warming Up Matters <a href="#why-warming-up-matters" id="why-warming-up-matters"></a>

Carriers keep an eye on texting behavior. They’re looking for patterns that match real human activity — not mass marketing.

If they see dozens of texts flying out with zero replies, or if every message looks the same, it’s a red flag. The result? You might get throttled, flagged, or even blocked.

#### What Carriers Like to See <a href="#what-carriers-like-to-see" id="what-carriers-like-to-see"></a>

* Back-and-forth conversations
* A good balance of sent and received messages
* Unique messages that don’t look automated

In short: if it feels human, you’re in the clear.

For the first 3 to 5 days after activating your SIM:

* Message at least **15 different contacts** (friends, family, colleagues — anyone you can chat with)
* Focus on real, back-and-forth conversations
* Avoid sending mass or identical messages

It doesn’t have to be complicated. A few real conversations per day is enough to build trust with your carrier.

Warming up your SIM isn’t about jumping through hoops — it’s about starting off on the right foot. A few days of thoughtful texting now can save you a lot of headaches later.

Just show your carrier you’re a human, not a robot.
