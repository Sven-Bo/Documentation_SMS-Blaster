# Settings Overview

The SMS Blaster tool comes with several easy-to-use settings to make your bulk messaging smoother:

* **Custom Delays:** Set a delay between each SMS to control the speed of sending and avoid triggering spam filters.
* **Column Selection:** Choose which columns in your Excel sheet hold the phone numbers and messages, making it flexible for different data setups.
* **Logging:** Turn on logging to help troubleshoot issues. It keeps track of whatâ€™s happening as messages are sent, so you can quickly spot and fix any problems.
