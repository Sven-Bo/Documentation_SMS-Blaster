Placeholders allow you to customize and personalize your SMS messages effortlessly. Here's how they work:

* **Global Placeholders:**\
  Use these for information that remains the same across all messages, such as your business name. For example, you can use `{{business_name}}` to automatically insert 'Sunshine Bakery' into each message.
* **Number-Specific Placeholders:**\
  These are used to personalize messages with details unique to each recipient. For instance, `{{customer_name}}` can be used to address each customer by their first name, making your messages more engaging.
* **Date Placeholders:**\
  When using placeholders for dates, ensure you format them correctly as outlined in the 'Placeholder Date Format' section to display dates accurately in your messages.
*   #### How to Add More Rows

    If you need to add more numbers for additional recipients, you can easily expand the table by adding new rows.

Before sending out mass messages, it's a good practice to enable 'Test Mode' in the settings. This allows you to verify that all placeholders are working correctly without actually sending the SMS. Always test before you text!
